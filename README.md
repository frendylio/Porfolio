In development

Todo:
- Add bouncing letters;

    Edwin:
    - so your stuff that's stickied top should have a solid background behind them
    - too much space in between the name of app/project and text
    - and then add more space between description and icons
    - also when you do the header background
    - you probably will also need to set the href or w/e u are using to a higher point
Bugs:
- Lets keep in touch! Bug with icons.
- Carousel, need to change it to flex.
- Carousel, fix elevator motion, when clicking down.

Normalize js query to either full js or j-query.
